    <p>
        This is an experimental feature. If the console becomes unresponsive for more than 30 seconds try Ctrl-C or refresh the page.
        Output from a command is only returned once a command has exited, so running interactive commands like <span class="code">powershell.exe</span>
        is <b>not</b> supported and will hang the console. However, <span class="code">powershell.exe -Command Get-Process</span> will work.
